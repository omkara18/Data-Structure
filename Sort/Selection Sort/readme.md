# Selection Sort
- Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. 
- This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm 
- In which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. 
- Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
- The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. 
- This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
