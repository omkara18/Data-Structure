# Bubble Sort
- Bubble Sort is the simplest of the sorting techniques.
- In the bubble sort technique, each of the elements in the list is compared to its adjacent element. Thus if there are n elements in list A, then A[0] is compared to A[1], A[1] is compared to A[2] and so on. After comparing if the first element is greater than the second, the two elements are swapped then.

# Pass
## First Pass: 
 '''(10 5 15 0 12) â€“> ( 5 10 15 0 12 )'''
>  Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 10>5 
 (5 10 15 0 12 )
